# Firestore Diagnostics Guide

## Overview

Comprehensive diagnostics have been added to track and analyze all Firestore reads in real-time.

---

## Features Added

### 1. **Automatic Logging**
Every Firestore query now logs:
- Operation type (getTodayOrders, aggregation, etc.)
- Collection accessed
- Number of documents read
- Source (which function/component called it)
- Timestamp

### 2. **Visual Dashboard**
A floating diagnostic panel shows:
- Total reads this session
- Breakdown by collection
- Breakdown by source
- Recent operations log
- Real-time updates

### 3. **Console Logging**
Every Firestore read logs to browser console:
```
üî• FIRESTORE READ [150 total]: {
  operation: "getTodayOrders",
  collection: "orders",
  reads: 45,
  source: "OrderService.getTodayOrders",
  time: "2:30:45 PM"
}
```

---

## How to Use

### **Step 1: Add Diagnostic Component to Your Layout**

Edit `/src/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import FirestoreDiagnostics from '@/components/diagnostics/FirestoreDiagnostics';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <AuthProvider>
          <MenuItemsProvider>
            <OrdersProvider>
              {children}

              {/* Add diagnostic panel - only shows in development */}
              {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <FirestoreDiagnostics />}
            </OrdersProvider>
          </MenuItemsProvider>
        </AuthProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### **Step 2: Restart the App**

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Use the Diagnostic Panel**

1. **Open your app** in the browser
2. **Look for orange floating button** in bottom-right corner
   - Shows total read count
3. **Click the button** to open diagnostic panel
4. **Navigate through the app** and watch reads accumulate

---

## Reading the Diagnostics

### **Total Reads Counter**
- Shows cumulative reads since page load
- Updates in real-time
- **Target**: <150 reads per normal session

### **Reads by Collection**
Shows which collections are being queried most:
```
orders: 100
expenses: 20
menu_items: 50
users: 1
```

### **Reads by Source**
Identifies which functions are causing reads:
```
OrderService.getTodayOrders: 45
ProfitCalculator.getDailyProfitTrend: 100
MenuItemService.getAllMenuItems: 50
```

**üîç Use this to find problem areas!**

### **Recent Operations**
Last 10 Firestore operations with:
- Operation name
- Document count
- Source function
- Timestamp

---

## Browser Console Commands

### **Get Full Stats**
```javascript
window.getFirestoreReadLog()
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "total": 150,
  "log": [...],
  "byCollection": {
    "orders": 100,
    "expenses": 20
  },
  "bySource": {
    "OrderService.getTodayOrders": 45,
    ...
  }
}
```

### **Export Stats to JSON**
```javascript
JSON.stringify(window.getFirestoreReadLog(), null, 2)
```

Copy and save for analysis.

---

## Troubleshooting High Reads

### **Warning Threshold**
Panel shows red warning if total reads > 1,000

### **Common Culprits**

#### **1. Reports Page Loading All Data**
```
üî• FIRESTORE READ [1500 total]:
  operation: "getOrdersPaginated"
  reads: 1000
  source: "ProfitCalculator.getOrdersInRange"
```

**Solution**: This is expected for first load. Check if it happens repeatedly.

#### **2. Duplicate Fetches**
```
üî• FIRESTORE READ [100 total]:
  source: "OrderService.getTodayOrders"
  reads: 50

üî• FIRESTORE READ [150 total]:
  source: "OrderService.getTodayOrders"
  reads: 50
```

**Problem**: Same data fetched twice!

**Solution**: Use context providers (already implemented).

#### **3. Queries in Loops**
```
üî• FIRESTORE READ [100 total]: reads: 100
üî• FIRESTORE READ [200 total]: reads: 100
üî• FIRESTORE READ [300 total]: reads: 100
...
```

**Problem**: Loop fetching data repeatedly.

**Solution**: Fetch once, filter in-memory (already fixed in profit-calculations.ts).

## Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Dashboard Load (First Time)**
**Expected reads**: ~150
- Auth check: 1
- Today's orders: ~50
- Today's expenses: ~20
- Menu items: ~50
- Stats aggregation: 3

**If you see 500+**: Problem! Check diagnostic panel for duplicates.

### **Scenario 2: Reports Page Load**
**Expected reads**: ~1,000-1,500
- 7-day orders: ~700
- 7-day expenses: ~100
- Aggregations: 3

**If you see 5,000+**: Old code still running! Make sure you restarted the server.

### **Scenario 3: Navigate Between Pages**
**Expected reads**: 0-50
- Should use cached data
- Only refresh when explicitly triggered

**If you see 100+ on every navigation**: Context not working properly.

## Interpreting Results

### ‚úÖ **Healthy Session** (Target)
```
Total Reads: 150-200 (first visit)
Total Reads: 50-100 (subsequent navigation)

By Collection:
  orders: 50
  expenses: 20
  menu_items: 50
  users: 1

By Source:
  OrderService.getTodayOrders: 50 (1x)
  MenuItemService.getAllMenuItems: 50 (1x - cached)
  ExpenseService.getTodayExpenses: 20 (1x)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning Signs**
```
Total Reads: 1,000+ (normal browsing)

By Source:
  OrderService.getTodayOrders: 250 (called 5x - duplicate!)
  MenuItemService.getAllMenuItems: 250 (5x - not cached!)
```

### üî¥ **Critical Issues**
```
Total Reads: 5,000+

By Source:
  ProfitCalculator.calculateProfit: 3,500 (loop issue!)
  OrderService.getAllOrders(5000): 5,000
```

---

## Comparison: Before vs After Optimization

### **Before Optimization**
```javascript
window.getFirestoreReadLog()

{
  total: 35000,
  bySource: {
    "ProfitCalculator.getDailyProfitTrend": 35000  // Loop!
  }
}
```

### **After Optimization**
```javascript
window.getFirestoreReadLog()

{
  total: 1200,
  bySource: {
    "ProfitCalculator.getOrdersInRange": 1000,  // Fetched once
    "ExpenseService.getExpensesByDateRange": 150,
    "OrderService aggregations": 3
  }
}
```

**Reduction**: 35,000 ‚Üí 1,200 reads (96.6% improvement!)

## Disabling Diagnostics in Production

### **Option 1: Conditional Rendering**
```tsx
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <FirestoreDiagnostics />}
```

### **Option 2: Environment Variable**
```tsx
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS === 'true' && <FirestoreDiagnostics />}
```

### **Option 3: Remove Component**
Just delete the `<FirestoreDiagnostics />` line from layout.

**Note**: Console logging will still work, but won't impact performance.

## Next Steps After Diagnosing

1. **Identify High-Read Sources**
   - Check "Reads by Source"
   - Find functions with >500 reads

2. **Analyze Patterns**
   - Are reads repeated?
   - Do they happen in loops?
   - Are components fetching independently?

3. **Apply Fixes**
   - Use context providers
   - Add caching
   - Use aggregation queries
   - Eliminate loops

4. **Verify Improvements**
   - Reset stats (reload page)
   - Perform same actions
   - Compare read counts

---

## Support

If you see unexpected high reads:

1. **Take a screenshot** of the diagnostic panel
2. **Copy console logs**: `window.getFirestoreReadLog()`
3. **Note what you did**: Which pages visited, buttons clicked
4. **Check Firebase Console**: Compare with actual billing

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do diagnostics impact performance?**
A: Minimal impact (~1-2ms per query). Negligible for development.

**Q: Are diagnostics accurate?**
A: Yes! They count actual `getDocs()` calls. However, they don't track:
- Document writes
- Realtime listeners (onSnapshot)
- Cloud Function reads

**Q: Can I see historical data?**
A: Currently only shows current session. Logs are cleared on page reload.

**Q: Why doesn't total match Firebase Console?**
A: Diagnostics track current browser session only. Firebase shows all requests including:
- Other users
- Other devices/tabs
- Server-side reads
- Previous sessions
